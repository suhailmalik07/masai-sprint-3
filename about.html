            <h1>About Rick and Morty</h1>
            <br>
            <p>An animated series that follows the exploits of a super scientist and his not-so-bright grandson.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland and Dan
                Harmon for Cartoon Network's late-night programming block Adult Swim. The series follows the
                misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted but fretful grandson Morty
                Smith, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Roiland voices the eponymous characters, with Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer and Sarah Chalke voicing the
                rest of the family. The series originated from an animated short parody film of Back to the Future,
                created by Roiland for Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Harmon. The series has been
                acclaimed by critics for its originality, creativity and humor. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The series has been picked up for an additional seventy episodes over an unspecified number of seasons.
                The fourth season premiered on November 10, 2019, and consists of ten episodes.</p>
